Description

MAP_NEURAL_STEEL uses neural network analysis to predict the Ac1 and Ac3
temperatures of steel. The Ac1 temperature is the temperature at the onset
of austenite formation. The Ac3 temperature is the temperature at the
completion of austenite formation.

The neural net was trained using 394 of a database of 788 examples, that was
constructed using information from published literature (Refs [2-7]). The
remaining 394 examples were used as `new' experiments to test the trained
network.

Optimum values for the number of hidden units (4 for Ac1 and 2 for Ac3) were
obtained from this. The whole dataset was then used to retrain the net to
give more accurate values for the weights.

The data that were used originally to train the neural network are are also
available for downloading. These data are not necessary to use the software
for the estimation of Ac1 and Ac3 temperature. They are nevertheless
available should you wish to conduct your own analysis. The file data.notes
contains information about the data in the database.

To run the program MAP_NEURAL_STEEL the following input files are
required :-

ACINPUT
     contains information on the chemical composition of the steel. An
     example ACINPUT is provided along with the source code.
     NB: It is necessary to properly specify the trace elements, which are
     in practice always there even though you may not have the analysis
     data. If the latter is true, then it is better to set the trace
     elements to average values rather than zero, since zero has a very
     significant meaning.

AC1, AC3
     contain neural information, and should not be altered. These files are
     also provided.

Parameters

Input parameters

     AW contains the input data from the file ACINPUT, which includes the
     chemical composition of the steel. See below for details of an example
     file.

     AMAX contains the maximum unnormalised values of the input variables
     (from the input files AC1 and AC3).

THETA1 - real array of dimension 4
     THETA1 contains the biases associated with W1, and is read in from the
     file AC1.

THETA2 - real
     THETA2 is the bias associated with W2, and is read in from the file
     AC1.

W1 - real array of dimension (4,22)
     W1 contains weights read in from the file AC1, which are coefficients
     used in the prediction of the Ac1 temperature.

W2 - real array of dimension 4
     W2 contains weights read in from the file AC1, which are coefficients
     used in the prediction of the Ac1 temperature.

     file AC3.

THETB2 - real
     THETB2 is the bias associated with W2B, and is read in from the file
     AC3.

W1B - real array of dimension (2,22)
     W1B contains weights read in from the file AC3, which are coefficients
     used in the prediction of the Ac3 temperature.

Output parameters

The program gives the Ac1 and Ac3 temperatures for a range of heating rates.
See below for an example showing the format of the output.



Error Indicators

None.



Accuracy

The neural net was trained using 394 examples from the available database.

The error is set at ±20% for 95% error limits.

If the temperature should become negative during the course of the
calculation of the Ac1 or Ac3 temperatures it is set to zero.



Further Comments

None.
