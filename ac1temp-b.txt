Purpose

To predict the Ac1 temperature of steel as a function of the chemical
composition and heating rate.



Specification

 Language:    FORTRAN
 Product form:Source code

SUBROUTINE MAP_NEURAL_AC1TEMP(AW,W1,W2,THETA1,THETA2,AMIN,AMAX,
&IMAX,Y,HT,IERR,IN,IHID,ERROR)

DOUBLE PRECISION AW(22),W1(4,22),W2(4),THETA1(4),THETA2,
&AMIN(22),AMAX(22),Y(20),HT(20),ERROR

INTEGER IERR(20),IMAX,IN,IHID



Description

MAP_NEURAL_AC1TEMP uses neural network analysis to predict the temperature
of the onset of austenite formation.

The neural net was trained using 394 of a database of 788 examples
constructed using information from Refs [2 - 7]. The remaining 394 examples
were used as `new' experiments to test the trained network. This database is
in the file `neural_dataset'.

Two input data files are needed for programs using MAP_NEURAL_AC1TEMP -
ACINPUT (which contains the information on the chemical composition of the
steel, and is read into the array AW), and AC1 (which contains neural
information, and should not be altered). These files are provided with the
program MAP_NEURAL_STEEL.

Parameters

Input parameters

AW - real array of dimension 22
     AW contains the input data from the file ACINPUT, which includes the
     chemical composition of the steel. See below for details of an example
     file.

AMIN - real array of dimension 22
     AMIN contains the minimum unnormalised values of the input variables
     (from the input file AC1).

AMAX - real array of dimension 22
     AMAX contains the maximum unnormalised values of the input variables
     (from the input file AC1).

THETA1 - real array of dimension 4
     THETA1 contains the biases associated with W1, and is read in from the
     file AC1.

THETA2 - real
     THETA2 is the bias associated with W2, and is read in from the file
     AC1.

W1 - real array of dimension (4,22)
     W1 contains weights read in from the file AC1, which are coefficients
     used in the prediction of the Ac1 temperature.

W2 - real array of dimension 4
     W2 contains weights read in from the file AC1, which are coefficients
     used in the prediction of the Ac1 temperature.

IN - integer
     IN is the number of inputs (22 for this model).

IHID - integer
     IHID is the number of hidden units (4 for this model).

IMAX - integer
     IMAX is the number of heating rates calculated (< 20).

Output parameters

HT - real array of dimension IMAX (< 20)
     HT contains the heating rates (in kelvin per second).

Y - real array of dimension IMAX
     Y contains the Ac1 temperature for each HT.

IERR - integer array of dimension IMAX
     IERR=0 if all inputs are within the range of the training dataset for
     the neural network (so the 95% confidence error bars are at about
     ±11%).
     IERR=1 if some inputs are outside the range of the training set for the
     neural network (so the 95% confidence error bars may then be greater
     than ±11%).
     See Ref [1] for further details.

ERROR - real
     ERROR is set at ±ERROR/2 for 95% confidence error limits (in joules).



Error Indicators

IERR is an integer array of dimension IMAX.

IERR=0 if all inputs are within the range of the training dataset for the
neural network (so the 95% confidence error bars are at about ±11%).

IERR=1 if some inputs are outside the range of the training set for the
neural network (so the 95% confidence error bars may then be greater than
±11%).
