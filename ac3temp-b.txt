Purpose

To predict the Ac3 temperature of steel as a function of the chemical
composition and the heating rate.



Specification

 Language:     FORTRAN
 Product form: Source code

SUBROUTINE MAP_NEURAL_AC3TEMP(AW,W1B,W2B,THETB1,THETB2,AMIN,AMAX,
&IMAX,Y,HT,IERR,IN,IHID,ERROR)

DOUBLE PRECISION AW(22),W1B(2,22),W2B(2),THETB1(2),THETB2,
&AMIN(22),AMAX(22),Y(20),HT(20),ERROR

INTEGER IERR(20),IMAX,IN,IHID



Description

MAP_NEURAL_AC3TEMP uses neural network analysis to predict the temperature
at the completion of austenite formation.

The neural net was trained using 394 of a database of 788 examples
constructed using information from Refs [2 - 7]. The remaining 394 examples
were used as `new' experiments to test the trained network. This database is
in the file `neural_dataset'.

Two input data files are needed for programs using MAP_NEURAL_AC3TEMP -
ACINPUT (which contains the information on the chemical composition of the
steel, and is read into the array AW), and AC3 (which contains neural
information, and should not be altered). These files are provided with the
program MAP_NEURAL_STEEL.

Parameters

Input parameters

AW - real array of dimension 23
     AW contains the input data from the file ACINPUT, which includes the
     chemical composition of the steel. See below for details of an example
     file.

AMIN - real array of dimension 23
     AMIN contains the minimum unnormalised values of the input variables
     (from the input files AC1 and AC3).

AMAX - real array of dimension 23
     AMAX contains the maximum unnormalised values of the input variables
     (from the input files AC1 and AC3).

THETB1 - real array of dimension 2
     THETB1 contains the biases associated with W1B, and is read in from the
     file AC3.

THETB2 - real
     THETB2 is the bias associated with W2B, and is read in from the file
     AC3.

W1B - real array of dimension (2,22)
     W1B contains weights read in from the file AC3, which are coefficients
     used in the prediction of the Ac3 temperature.

W2B - real array of dimension 2
     W2B contains weights read in from the file AC3, which are coefficients
     used in the prediction of the Ac3 temperature.

IN - integer
     IN is the number of inputs (22 for this model).

IHID - integer
     IHID is the number of hidden units (2 for this model).

IMAX - integer
     IMAX is the number of heating rates calculated (< 20).

Output parameters

HT - real array of dimension IMAX (< 20)
     HT contains the heating rates (in kelvin per second).

Y - real array of dimension IMAX
     Y conains the Ac3 temperature associated with each heating rate in HT.

IERR - integer array of dimension IMAX
     IERR=0 if all inputs are within the range of the training dataset for
     the neural network (so the 95% confidence error bars are at about
     ±11%).
     IERR=1 if some inputs are outside the range of the training set for the
     neural network (so the 95% confidence error bars may then be greater
     than ±11%).
     See Ref [1] for further details.

ERROR - real
     ERROR is set at ±ERROR/2 for 95% cofidence error limits (in joules).



Error Indicators

The elements of the array IERR take values:

IERR=0 if all inputs are within the range of the training dataset for the
neural network (so the 95% confidence error bars are at about ±11%).

IERR=1 if some inputs are outside the range of the training set for the
neural network (so the 95% confidence error bars may then be greater than
±11%).

See [1] for further details.
